<!--
A situation report should tell infrastructure maintainers everything they need
to know to start troubleshooting a problem or to learn from a problem that is
already resolved. Please use dates and approximate times when describing
events.

Keeping it brief saves time for them and for you; this shouldn't take more than
10 minutes to write.
